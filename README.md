# ReactVR

Welcome to this ReactVR course. This course will help you understand the most basics elements of ReactVR. Please follow the guide and answer the questions. A proposed solutions for every task is found in X/Y folder. 

## Getting Started
This course requires that you have node installed. Please follow the next steps if you have not installed node before. 
- Download the latest stable version from node.org. 
- To verify, write ```node -v``` in the terminal / console application. 
- To verify that npm is also installed, write ```npm -v``` in the terminal / console application.
- After cloning this project, remember to ```npm install``` before you start this course.

## Task 1 - Init you ReactVR project
This task will explain how you init your ReactVR project. Open up the **Basics/index.vr.js** file and take a brief look inside it. This will be the main file we are going to work with. But first, let's take a look into the file **Basics/vr/client.js**. Above line 12 ```...options,``` add ```enableHotReload: true,``` and hit save. This will enable the hot reloader. That is, our application will automatically relode it's view whenever we save a change inside our code! 

Now go back to your terminal / console application and write ```npm start```. Ooops! Remember du ```cd``` into the Basic folder, if you have not done so yet! (Psst. ```cd``` stand for change directory and is the same as opening the folder in the finder app or directory on you mac/computer). When the terminal / console is done building your reactVR project go ahead and open http://localhost:8081/vr/. By the way, loading the page can take some time, expesially the first time you are doing it. 

Open up the **Basics/index.vr.js** file, and as you see there are three compoenets inside the Basics React Component. View, Pano and Text. 
- ```<View>```: This component determinates the view, and you define whatever you want to include inside your view by putting it inside this component. 
- ```<Pano>```: Pano is short for panorama. In this component you can select the background image. We have added some more pano images for you in the folder **Basics/static_assets/**. Go ahead and try to change the pano image to something else in this folder!
- ```<Text>```: This is one of the most simpliest components that is included in react-vr. The text component will simply add a text to your view. There are many other components supported by the react-vr package. For example: Box, Circle, Sylinder and even Image and Video! We will come back to what all the props inside the compoents means later in this course. 

## Task 2 - Add your first react-vr component! 
Okay, so this task is going to give you an introduction to placing a react-vr component into your view. Go ahead and remove the text component from the **Basics/index.vr.js** file, because we are not going to use this element for this task. Instead import the Box element from react-vr and add a ```<Box/>``` inside your view. 

Did you try to refresh the page? Do you see it? 

No! And there is a simple explaination to this. You cannot see the ```<Box/>``` component inside your view yet because you havn´t told the size of it! Make sense? 

Okay, so the next step is to tell your view how big you want to visualize your ```<Box/>``` component. 

Start by adding these four props to your ```<Box/>``` component:
- ```dimWidth```
- ```dimHeight```
- ```dimDepth```
- ```wireframe = {true} ```

The three first values determinates the width, height and depth of the ```<Box/>``` component. Set each of the values to be equal to something between 0 and 1, because we don't want the box to be too big 😉. In ReactVR the dimention is measured in meters, therefore it is often seen values between 0 and 1 in reactVR projects. Wireframe equals true is just to see the outline of the box, and is just for helping us see the dimention of the ```<Box/>``` component easier. 

Try to reload the page and see what happens.
